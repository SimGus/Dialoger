# This file contains descriptions of all the slots that can be understood and
# filled by the bot. Each slot has a type ('categorical', 'integer', 'float',
# 'boolean' or 'percentage'), a summary as a string that the bot can use to
# describe the slot to the user in messages and the accepted values for the
# slot which are client-specific.
# The summary should be a common name that can be put in a sentence such as
# "Did you say SOMETHING for the ...?" and shouldn't have a trailing dot or a
# keading uppercase letter.
# !!! Current client: La Louviere !!!
# TODO put client specific data in another file?
