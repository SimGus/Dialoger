# This file contains rough descriptions of the user intents.
# we split intents into three different categories:
#   - The "triggering" intents
#     They can trigger a new goal for the bot to pursue. Those intent mean the
#     user has the initiative (whether they were given it or took it)
#     and changes the subject of the conversation.
#   - The "informing" intents
#     They usually answer a question of the bot, informing it of the value of
#     some slots. For example, it would be an answer to "which line are you
#     talking about?"
#   - The "confirmation request answer" intents
#     They are answers to a bot's request to confirm, i.e. a confirmation
#     or a denial of what the bot requested to confirm. For example,
#     they would be an answer to the question "Did you mean 'line number 2'?".
#     Note that a denial could be accompanied by a "informing" intent and
#     thus be considered to be in this category. However, a confirmation is
#     always in this category.
# There are also sub-categories inside categories:
#   - in "triggering":
#     * query
#     * analysis
#     * recommendation
#   - in "informing"
#     none
#   - in "confirmation request answer":
#     * confirm
#     * deny
#
# Each intent also has a summary which is a string that the bot will use to
# ground intents in sentences such as "did you want to ...?". Those
# summary thus need to be written in the format "do something" from the
# viewpoint of the bot, without a trailing dot and without a leading uppercase
# letter.
#
# Finally, each intent has some expected entities and some allowed entities.
# That is, it is expected to find an "expected" entity with this intent, and it
# is permitted to find some "allowed" entities with it, but if they are not
# there, it is not that problematic. Finding other entities will make the bot
# less sure it has well understood.
